Attach the GhostFreeRoamCamera script to any camera and your ready to run.
Requires Camera Component
The public variables are:
	* Initial Speed; the start speed when moving
	* Increase Speed; velocity / speed over time (additive to initial speed)
	* Allow Movement; can the camera move (position)
	* Allow Rotation; can the camera turn (rotation)
	* Forward Button; the button that will make the camera go forward
	* Backward Button; the button that will make the camera go backward
	* Right Button; the button that will make the camera go right
	* Left Button; the button that will make the camera go left
	* Cursor Sensitivity; how quicky the camera will rotate
	* Cursor Toggle Allowed; can the cursor lock and be hidden
	* Cursor Toggle Button; button to toggle the cursor lock and hidden on / off

NOTE: The Unity editor restricts some cursor locking, but will fully work in a build "Maximize On Play"
      will help to slightly overcome this when using this script in the Unity editor

NOTE: May effect global transform attributes and screen (locks and cursor)
